This project is an update from https://github.com/AzenoX/rgstry-context-menu-creator with a focus on JetBrains Apps

PS: It seems to work only on Windows 10


## Usage

Access the project: https://jetbrains.alexishayat.me/

In the "Base JetBrains Path", define the absolute path where jetbrains' apps are installed.

In "Choose JetBrains App", well, select the app :D

Finally, in Build Version, enter the build number you want to open with the shortcut (You can navigate through the jetbrains path in your folders to get this number).

Check "Is 64 bits" if you're running a 64 bits application.

Then, click on "Generate .reg", you'll be able to copy the code, or to download .reg directly.
